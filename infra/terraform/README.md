# Terraform Infrastructure

This directory will contain Terraform configurations for cloud deployment (AWS, GCP, Azure, or Vercel).

## Future Implementation

Infrastructure-as-Code will be implemented in Phase 2 or Phase 3 once the hosting provider is determined.

Planned resources:

- Database (RDS/Cloud SQL)
- API hosting (ECS/Cloud Run/App Service)
- Frontend hosting (Vercel/S3+CloudFront/CDN)
- Networking (VPC, subnets, security groups)
- Monitoring and logging
